# Create React App example with Material-UI, TypeScript, Redux and Routing

This is a new verison with React Hooks, Material-UI 4 (alpha) and React-Redux 7 (beta). We use this template for all our new projects. But if you want a well testet one with no alphas and betas you can use the [previous version](https://github.com/innFactory/create-react-app-material-typescript-redux/tree/v1) with class componets and very stable dependencies.

## How to use

Download or clone this repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/innFactory/create-react-app-material-typescript-redux
cd create-react-app-material-typescript-redux
```

Install it and run:

```bash
npm i
npm start
```

## Enable PWA ServiceWorker [OPTIONAL]
Just comment in the following line in the `index.tsx`:
```javascript

```
to
```javascript
registerServiceWorker();
```

## Enable tslint in VSCode [OPTIONAL]
 1. Step: Install the TSLint plugin of Microsoft
 2. Add the following snippet to your settings in VSCode:
 ```json
     "editor.codeActionsOnSave": {

After that you can start to type `fcomp` (_for function component_) and you get a template for a new component.
